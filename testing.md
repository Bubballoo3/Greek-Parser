# Greek Parser Testing

The testing consists of three levels of words. 
For each level, we give 20 words of varying parts of speech.

The model is scored on each word out of 5, losing points for each part of the parsing they get wrong.
An additional point is lost if the formatting is not right, such as forgetting to include a dictionary entry (if they know there is one).
