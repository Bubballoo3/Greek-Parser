Agentic AI Greek Parser

This agentic system uses LangGraph to connect a chatGPt model to a set of tools that give it precise knowledge about Ancient Greek syntax and forms. 
This allows us to produce accurate parsing and translation of words without hallucination. 

## Resources
Some external files that are accessed via tools by the model. 
If you are running in Google Colab, you will have to upload the entire "resources" folder to the colab session in order for it to work
