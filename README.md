# Greek-Parser
Agentic AI Greek Parser

This agentic system uses LangGraph to connect a chatGPT model to a set of tools that give it precise knowledge about Ancient Greek syntax and forms. 
This allows us to produce accurate parsing and translation of words without hallucination. 

## Resources
Some external files that are accessed via tools by the model. 
If you are running in Google Colab, you will have to upload the entire "resources" folder to the colab session in order for it to work

- Liddel and Scott's *Greek-English Lexicon* (source: [Perseids Project/lsj-js](https://github.com/perseids-project/lsj-js.git))
- A verb contraction sheet from Prof. Helma Dik of the University of Chicago (Source: [Nifty Greek Handouts](https://classics.uchicago.edu/people/helma-dik/nifty-greek-handouts)), converted into a string by ChatGPT. 
- A noun ending sheet fully generated by ChatGPT
##  Testing

- The testing consists of three levels of words. 
- At each level, we give words of varying parts of speech.
- At the easy and medium level, examples are drawn from Aelian's *Epistulae Rusticae*. Hard examples are drawn from multiple sources to test Attic, Homeric, and Ionian dialects.
- The model is scored on each word out of 5, losing points for each part of the parsing they get wrong.
An additional point is lost if the formatting is not right, such as forgetting to include a dictionary entry (if they know there is one). 
- All inputs lack accents and breathings.

### Easy Words - 97% accurate (58/60 points)
Easy words consist of common nouns and present tense verbs, differing at most two letters from dictionary form. Frequency refers to the root word and is a ranking from most to least common, or is unranked if it appears less than 50 times in the corpus.

### Medium Words - 89% accurate (40/45 points)
Medium words are less frequent (> 2000 rank), expand to all tenses and moods, and generally require more logical steps to decipher.

| **Word** | **Frequency** | **Response** | **Score** | **Explanation**|
| -------- |---------------| ------------ | --------- | ---------------|
|χρηματιζεσθαι |2162nd| **Word**: χρηματιζεσθαι <br> **Root**: χρηματίζω <br> **Form**: Infinitive, middle-passive <br> **Meaning**: "to negotiate" or "to deal with financial matters," specifically in a context where one is engaging in business for personal profit. | 4/5 | Did not specify tense, in this case "present" |
| διακωλυσας |2690th|  **Word**: διακωλυσας <br> **Root**: διακωλύω<br> **Form**: Aorist active indicative, second person singular <br> **Meaning**: "you hindered" or "you prevented" | 5/5 | |

| επιλειψας |2569th| **Word**: επιλειψας <br> **Root**: ἐπιλείπω <br> **Form**: Aorist active participle, masculine singular nominative <br> **Meaning**: "having left behind" or "having fallen short" | 5/5|
| συναντωντας |4502nd| **Identify the root**: The root is "συναντάω," which is a verb. <br> **Determine the form**: The suffix "ντας" suggests that this word is a participle form of the verb. <br> **Check for definitions**: After checking "συναντάω" and related forms, I confirmed that it means "to meet" or "to encounter," but I couldn't find an exact match for "συναντωντας." <br> **Conclusions** Given the structure of "συναντωντας," it is likely a masculine accusative plural form of the participle, meaning "those who are meeting" or "the ones who meet." However, without a direct LSJ entry, I cannot provide a full definition. | 4/5 | Found the root word, but did not cite the definition. Generated correct parse and definition. |
| ζηλουμεν |2002nd| **Word**: ζηλούμεν <br> **Root**: ζηλόω <br> **Form**: 1st person plural present indicative active <br> **Meaning**: "we are zealous" or "we envy" | 5/5 | Did put the wrong accent on the word as it recited it, but rest of response is good. |

| αρπασθεισεων |1126th| **Root Word**: The word is derived from "ἁρπάζω." <br> **Form**: The ending "-θεισεων" suggests a genitive plural form that might relate to an abstract noun indicating actions or states of seizing, possibly referring to the results or consequences of such actions. <br> **Part of Speech**: It is likely a noun, specifically in the genitive plural form. | 3/5 | Did not parse the aorist passive participle correctly, but did identify dictonary form and gave a good approximation of the definition |









### Hard Words - 63% accurate (19/30 points)
Hard words involve non-attic dialects, rare words, and contracted forms
| **Word** | **Frequency** | **Response** | **Score** | **Explanation**|
| -------- | -------------|------------ | --------- | ---------------|
| αναθηλαι |unranked <nobr>(<50 times)| **Word**: αναθηλαι <br> **Root**: αναθήμα <br> **Meaning**: Likely relates to the act of dedicating or offering, especially in a religious or ceremonial context. | 1/5 | As an aorist infinitive from αναθαλλω. Due to its rarity in the corpus, it had little intuition about the root, and picked a similar word as a guess. It did admit its failure, so while it is wrong, it isnt misleading|
| σμηνη |unranked <nobr>(<50 times)| **Word**: σμηνη <br> **Root**: σμήν <br> **Form**: Nominative singular feminine <br> **Meaning**: "hive" or "swarm" | 2/5| This form is the irregular plural of the neuter σμῆνος. The model was unable to arrive at this root form, and introduced σμήν, an unrelated word, without looking up the definition. 
| σμικροτητα|unranked <nobr>(<50 times)| **Word**: σμικρότητα <br> **Root**: σμικρός <br> **Form**: Abstract noun <br> **Meaning**: "smallness" or "petty quality" | 3/5 | It found the correct root but did not parse the form.
|γειτονημα |unranked <nobr>(<50 times)| **Word**: γειτονηματι <br> **Root**: γειτόνημα <br> **Form**: Likely a dative or locative case (based on the ending). <br> **Meaning**: "in the neighbourhood" or "to the neighbourhood." | 4/5 | Parse and definition are good except missing singular/plural. |
| αποφραδων |unranked <nobr>(<50 times)| **Root**: ἀποφράς <br> **Form**: Likely a genitive plural or related form of an adjective <br> **Meaning**: "of the unlucky ones" or "of those who are blocked" | 5/5 | Small formatting mistake of not citing the input word, but overall good|
| αθανατιζοντες |unranked <nobr>(<50 times)|  **Word**: αθανατιζοντες <br> **Root**: ἀθανατίζω <br> **Form**: Aorist active participle, masculine plural nominative <br> **Meaning**: "those who make (something) immortal" or "those who regard (something) as immortal" | 4/5 | Mistakenly parsed as aorist, when it is a present participle |
